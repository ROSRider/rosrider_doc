### TODO: exp

After starting roscore on a Terminal, Open Another Terminal Window, and execute the following commands:

    roscd rosrider/config
    rosparam load rosrider.config
    rosrun rosserial_python serial_node.py _port:=/dev/ttyACM0 _baud:=230400

It should generate some output like:

>***Make sure your robot / setup is in a jack, i.e. the wheels do not touch the ground.***


### Verification of motor direction

Open a Terminal Window, and execute the following command:

    rostopic pub /left_wheel/control_effort ... -r 20

Publishing positive values to ```/left_wheel/control_effort```, should result in forward motion of the wheel. 
Publishing negative values to ```/left_wheel/control_effort```, should result in reverse motion of the wheel.

If not, change ```left_reverse``` to true, in parameter file, re-load rosparam file by typing ```rosparam load rosrider.yaml``` in the ```rosrider/config``` directory.

Repeat the same procedure for the right wheel.


### Verification of encoder direction

Open a Terminal Window, and execute the following command:

    rostopic echo /left_wheel/state

Should show an output such as:

```console
0.0
0.0
0.0
0.0
```

On Another Window, execute the following command:

    rostopic pub /left_wheel/control_effort ... -r 20

Publishing positive values to ```/left_wheel/control_effort```, should result in positive values displayed on the console.
Publishing negative values to ```/left_wheel/control_effort```, should result in negative values displayed on the console.

If not, change ```left_swap``` to true, in parameter file, re-load rosparam file by typing ```rosparam load rosrider.yaml``` in the ```rosrider/config``` directory.

Repeat the same procedure for the right wheel.

### Verification of Gear Ratio and Encoder PPR

First setup the wheel with an external optical RPM meter.

Then publish positive values to ```/left_wheel/control_effort``` while plotting rpm values on ```/left_wheel/state``` with rqt_plot.

    rostopic pub /left_wheel/control_effort ... -r 20

From another command window:

    rqt_plot /left_wheel/state

The values read from ```/left_wheel/state``` should match the output of optical RPM meter.

If not change ```gear_ratio``` and ```encoder_ppr``` in parameter file, re-load rosparam file by typing ```rosparam load rosrider.yaml``` in the ```rosrider/config``` directory.

Repeat the procedure until you get it right. Sometimes the documentation for an encoder motor ordered from the internet might not be exact. First determine the ```encoder_ppr``` and then determine ```gear_ratio```

### Wheel Diameter Verification

To continue further, close the ```rosserial_python``` and the ```roscore``` by pressing CTRL-C on the console.

Open A Terminal Window, and execute the following commands:

    roscd rosrider/launch
    roslaunch robot.launch

It will launch the serial node, pid, differential drive controller, odometry node, and teleoperation.  
It should generate some output like:

```console
Capture output and put as a file
```

If given a goal that is (wheel_dia * N) away from 0, wheel should turn N time, and robot should move wheel_dia * N meters.

First Set RVIZ

### Base Width Verification

Given an angular twist command, turn speed of the robots in Radians / Second should match.

---
### RVIZ Test of goal controller

Robot must go to goal point 1 meter or 2 meter away

---
### Motor Current Limit Determination

Put it on rqt view and show some examples

---
### Main Current Limit Determination

Put it on rqt view, and test stalls.

---

### pid calibration with dynamic reconfigure tutotial, explain pid params dont have to do with board
